# SPDE Network Triangulation for Traffic Accident Prediction

This repository contains the methodology and implementation for creating a network mesh specifically designed for traffic accident prediction using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach. The following instructions outline the steps necessary to create the SPDE network triangulation based on road networks.

## Overview

The traditional methods of model prediction using a region mesh are not suitable for traffic accident data, as they may predict accidents in areas without road networks. To address this, we introduce a novel SPDE triangulation approach that focuses on road networks. The process involves several key steps:

1. Access the OSM road network.
2. Create a buffer for each road segment.
3. Generate a clipped buffer polygon.
4. Apply network triangulation.

## Prerequisites

- R programming environment
- Required R packages: `osmdata`, `stplanr`, and `INLA`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Access OSM Road Network

Utilize the `osmdata` R package to extract the road network for your study region. 

```r
# Install and load the necessary package
install.packages("osmdata")
library(osmdata)

# Access road network
# Define your area of interest and fetch the OSM data
# Example: region <- opq(bbox = "Your bounding box here") %>% osmdata_sf()
